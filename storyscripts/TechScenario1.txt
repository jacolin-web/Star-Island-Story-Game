Someone on a tech list suggests forming an open civic tech group. All these people respond stating their interest in becoming involved. Bryce, however, never hears back about anything. Bryce reaches out to find out the status of the group, and no response. What's next? Does she continue pursuing interest in joining this group, or does she walk away?
