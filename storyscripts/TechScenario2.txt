Bryce finds out about an upcoming tech event and
contacts one of the organizers about covering the event. She is new to the playing field, but not the subject matter. As a matter of fact, she is very well acquainted with it and would make the perfect communicator. However, it's very much a boys' club environment, and so the men involved don't feel comfortable having a new kid on the  block, especially a woman, be responsible for the coverage. Not only could it be a gender issue, but a related "trust issue" as well.
