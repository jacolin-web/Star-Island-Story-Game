 Bryce was hired to be on the partner track.  But she is being passed by. She attends meetings but is not invited to the golf outings where the deals are done.   The bigger deals are handed to other associates.
Bryce: 
1.  Asks to work with the one female partner and develops a mentor relationship.  
2.  Takes "executive training" sessions and learns how to play golf.   
3.   Bryce walks the fine line between being assertive and not being labelled a "b-tch".
