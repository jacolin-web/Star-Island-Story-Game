Bryce drops the story and loses heart in general. Not only is she disappointed, she is devastated. She won't be part of this catalytic event she has been working towards for months, and perhaps longer. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Itâ€™s a LOSE:LOSE situation. She loses because she's left out of the story. The people involved in the event would lose because they wouldn't be privy to her vast knowledge base on the matter and related contacts. Now she doesn't aggressively pursue big stories because she expects to always encounter barriers to entry. Bryce is demoted to covering mobile apps exclusively. Her link to important people in the industry falls by the wayside, so she has to "start all over again". Perhaps NOW she will learn patience and perseverance.
