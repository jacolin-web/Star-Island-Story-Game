Bryce wants the story very badly, but she isn't getting through to anyone. Sheâ€™s thinking of writing it on her own and hopes that the knowledge she acquires during the event through informal interviews and discussions with other attendees and speakers will get her enough material to write the story anyway. People open up to her not realizing that she is actually working on a story. She is walking down a slippery slope here. Chances are there will be important people she has connected with who like her and would be able to help her in the future, but would not appreciate it if she published information they had shared with her off the record. Does she risk burning some important bridges before they're even completely built just so she can get 1 (albeit important) story published? Bryce ponders over this option for quite some time before deciding that one story is not worth the price she might have to pay in the short and long terms. Her climb to the top is slow for a while, but later on, people remember how trustworthy she is, and they start to slowly turn to her for more important coverages. It's been hit or miss for a long time, but she becomes an Executive Editor of Tech with The Wall Street Journal and travels all over the world to cover events.
