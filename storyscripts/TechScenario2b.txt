Bryce wants this big tech story so badly that she decides to tune out the difficulties presented to her by the event organizers and go for the gold. She bites the bullet and decides that it is worth putting up with this boys club even though she finds it hard to deal with them and their cultural perspectives. She lets them know what they would lose by not including her in their event coverage. She works for a smaller organization, but is good friends with the Senior Editor of TechCrunch and ex NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg. They are dying to connect with him, but she has to decide whether they are worth handing over such valuable assets. What does she get back in return? Bryce goes on to covering major tech events such as TechCrunch Disrupt, Startup Weekends all over the world, various TechStars Demo Days, Big Data TechCon Boston, JSConf Budapest, and more!
