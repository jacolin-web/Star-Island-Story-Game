Since making the decision to "play nice" with
the President, Bryce starts steadily climbing up the political ladder.
She meets a local NY Congressman, "falls in love", 
and gets married. Months into the marriage, she  finds out that her
husband has been sexting and tweeting revealing photos of himself 
to young women all over Twitter. Meanwhile, she has held a key aide
position to the former first lady since leaving the white house. Yes, that 
compromise she worked out with the Prez had worked out to her advantage,
and she got to end up being key support to the former first wife. But personal drama seems
to follow her wherever she goes. Does she stay with her husband and support him through the mess he has created for
the sake of family (she's just found out she's pregnant)? The first lady had done the same with
her man. Does she leave him and preserve her self respect and save her boss from incidental embarrassment as well? OR does 
she leave her husband AND stop working for the former first lady as well?
